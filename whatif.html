    <!-- Geography Reversal (expanded) -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>🌎 Geography Reversal — The Biblical Landscape in the Americas</h2>

      <h3>Our Core Claim</h3>
      <p>If “corn” in the Bible means maize, then the Biblical world was not across the ocean in the so-called Middle East — it was in the Americas. More precisely: the Levant, Egypt, Ethiopia,  were geographically in the Americas, and only later superimposed and displaced and re-anchored in Europe’s fabricated “Holy Land" and so-called Middle East.</p>
      <p>The ancient descriptions of the Levant, Egypt, Jerusalem and other nations and cities fits the Americas. With thousands of pyramids and temples in Mexico, Central America and South America. The proof is encoded in the very texts: a land flowing with corn, wine, and oil. Since corn = maize, and maize is an exclusively American crop, these writings can only be describing the Americas — the real Biblical lands.</p>

      <h3>Key Relocations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower Egypt = Mexico</strong> — fertile valleys, floodplains, and canal systems mirror the agricultural heart of Biblical Egypt.</li>
        <li><strong>Upper Egypt = Peru</strong> — Andean highlands, sacred valleys, and mountain civilizations embody Upper Egypt.</li>
        <li><strong>Jerusalem = Cusco (Peru)</strong> — a highland capital in the Andes, built “in the top of the mountains,” fits the Biblical pattern exactly.</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>📖 Zion & Jerusalem in the High Mountains</h3>
      <blockquote>“The mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains” (Isaiah 2:2, Micah 4:1).</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion… the city of the great King” (Psalm 48:1–2).</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“In mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel… there will I accept them” (Ezekiel 20:40).</blockquote>
      <p>This is highland civilization, set among the world’s most exalted ranges — imagery that matches the Andes, not the false Levant in the Middle East.</p>

      <h3>📖 Surrounded by Mountains</h3>
      <blockquote>“As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people” (Psalm 125:1–2).</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“His foundation is in the holy mountains” (Psalm 87:1–2).</blockquote>
      <p>Cusco — set in a high basin and ringed by ridges — mirrors this vision far more accurately than the site later mislabeled “Jerusalem” by European scholars.</p>

      <h3>Impact</h3>
      <p>These scriptures expose the geographic fraud that has underpinned academia and theology for 1,500 years. Zion, Egypt, and Palestine were  always in the Americas. The world knew these things...truth began to be rewritten after 1492.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Levant of scripture was in the Americas.</li>
        <li>The so-called Palestinian Levant in the Middle East is a colonial misplacement, manufactured to anchor empire and erase truth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Corn in the Bible is the hidden key. For over 500 years its true meaning was covered up, but now it reveals the real geography of scripture — the Americas. This truth opens the door for us to research, study, and compare notes with clear eyes, placing the world back on a firm foundation. The people, places and events of the Bible were in the Americas. Not in the so-called Middle East. From here begins healing and beneficial progress for the human family of all nations, creeds, colors, and religions.</p>

    <!-- History & Civilization (restored) -->
<div class="card">
  <h2>🏛 History & Civilization — Israel in the Americas</h2>

  <h3>Our Core Claim</h3>
  <p>
    If “corn” in the Bible means maize, then the civilizations of the Bible were in the Americas. Palestine, Mesopotamia, Canaan, and Egypt existed here. 
    The Israelites — tribes, prophets, and kings — lived, built, and worshipped on the Western continent (There are ONLY two continents. The Easten continent and the Western continent. The Westen continent is North America and Suuth America. The place the ancient Egyptians called the "Two lands"...).
  </p>

  <h3>Ancient American Parallels</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pyramids & Temples</strong> — The stepped pyramids of Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru match the Biblical descriptions of altars, high places, and temple-mountains (Genesis 28:12; 1 Kings 6). The Bible and Other ancient WRITTEN records describe these cities, temples and pyramids. </li>
    <li><strong>Sacred Centers</strong> — Cities like Teotihuacan, Tikal, and Cusco served as religious-political capitals, just as Jerusalem and Samaria did in scripture. Teotihuacan, Mexico is the ancient city called Heliopolis by the Greeks, Annu/Innu of the ancient Egyptians and the city called "On" in the Bible.</li>
    <li><strong>Kings & Prophets</strong> — 
  The Biblical kings and patriarchs — Solomon, David, Abraham, and many others — lived and ruled in the Americas. 
  The cities and holy sites, such as Moab, Shiloh, On, Nob, Ai, Bethlehem and Mamre, etc. were all 
  located in the Americas, not in the so-called Middle East. These names, preserved in scripture, correspond 
  to the sacred geography of the Americas where Israelite tribes, prophets, and rulers actually dwelt.
</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Scriptural Echoes in Civilization</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tower of Babel & American Pyramids</strong> — Genesis 11 describes a tower “whose top may reach unto heaven.” This mirrors the ziggurat-style pyramids of the Americas.</li>
    <li><strong>Storehouses of Joseph</strong> — Genesis 41 describes grain storage “as the sand of the sea.” Maize storage pits and granaries across Mesoamerica embody this system.</li>
    <li><strong>High Places & Sacred Mountains</strong> — The prophets condemned “high places” of worship, yet also exalted Mount Zion. The Andes and Mesoamerican pyramid-temples preserve this dual reality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Impact</h3>
  <p>
    This reframing shows that the great civilizations of the Americas are the Biblical civilizations. 
    The record of Israel is not in ruins overseas, but in the standing stones, pyramids, and sacred 
    cities of this hemisphere. The Bible is not foreign history — it is the true memory of these lands 
    and peoples.
